# SAS-Landing-page-CSS-HTML-website:
This project is a frontend website with limited functionallity, coded with CSS, HTML and a bit of JavaScript.  
I will follow a youtube tutorial [Professional Website From Scratch | HTML & CSS For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXYZxVbWkjc) on building website for beginners so I can learn How to code in CSS and HTML.

The purpose of this project is to gain a basic understanding of building a responsive website with HTML and CSS
and a little of javascript to create the hamburger menu and the FAQ accordion.

## A list of concepts I learn were: 
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
  - Media Queries (responsiveness)
  - CSS Positioning
  - CSS Variables
